# My Basic React Project Template
This is my personal project template for React projects, which I often use as a base for further configuration. The stack includes webpack, TypeScript, CSS modules and of course React.

The template comes with a few common scripts I use, which I run with `yarn` or `npm run`.

- `build` to create a production build, uglified
- `build-dev` to create a dev build
- `watch` - to run the watch script
- `devserver` - to start a webpack-dev-server
